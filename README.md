# The Amazing Mini-DRSSTC
This is a fully deigned open source DRSSTC project. Every file (from the PCB CAD to MCAD) is available in this Repo/Submodules. There will eventually be a little guide on how to build them too, although you are gpoing to need some semi-advanced equipment and definetely should have good knowledge about electroncis in general. So sorry, but no beginner project :D

# what can it do?
The finished coil will be about 0.5-0.6m tall (with a 30cm secondary), so probably only gonna make arcs <1m right? wrong! in my testing I've pushed that little thing to 20kw and got **over 1.5m long groundstrikes** out of it (not just streamers).
Although the power input couldn't handle that much power permanently. So overall absolutely rock solid performance I'd say 8)

Here's some media:

# Why the heck are you releasing this? Just sell it and make it worth your time
Well I thought about it buuuut try telling your insurance agency that you're selling literal lightning machines to random people on the internet, not gonna work out well (I've tried :P). I also do not have the energy to to support calls for this (that does to a point include questions regarding this repo right here too), and i don't feel as bad when releasing it without actually getting payed for it.
In the end I am already happy to see other people building something I designed :) So if you want to make me happy, post about your build on social media or send me an email about it ;)
If you really want to support me then I'll might just eventually add my paypal.me here so you can buy me a coffe too.
